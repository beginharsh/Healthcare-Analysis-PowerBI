# Healthcare-Analysis-PowerBI
Healthcare Revenue, Insurance, and Operations analytics Project using Power BI, DAX and Data Modeling

## Overview
This project analyzes hospital performance using visit-level data to evaluate
Revenue, Insurance Dependency, Doctor Performance, and Operational Efficiency.

Dataset contains ~5,000 patient visits across departments, diagnoses,
procedures, insurance providers, and service types.

## Business Questions Addressed
- How is hospital revenue distributed across departments and procedures?
- What percentage of revenue depends on insurance vs out-of-pocket payments?
- Which doctors drive revenue, and at what satisfaction cost?
- How do emergency visits impact volume, revenue, and patient experience?
- Where do operational bottlenecks affect satisfaction and length of stay?
